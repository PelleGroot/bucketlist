# 6-6
Started working on the authentication

# 7-6
Finished the authentication with email and password and create the activities I now can think of that I would need for this app

# 8-6
Started working on setting up the firebase database. Got the userId from authentication as userId in the database.

#11-6
Got the database working and started working on getting the adapter working in my bucketlistview. Still had an issue with the adapter on the end of the day.

#12-6
Thanks to Nina from the daily standup, I got the adapter working properly. And also implemented the google places API. And started working on the details screen of the activities.

#13-6
Decided to not use the reminder. The idea of the bucketlist app is not to stress you out about stuff you need to do.
