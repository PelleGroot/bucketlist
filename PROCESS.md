### 6-6
Started working on the authentication

### 7-6
Finished the authentication with email and password and create the activities I now can think of that I would need for this app

### 8-6
Started working on setting up the firebase database. Got the userId from authentication as userId in the database.

### 11-6
Got the database working and started working on getting the adapter working in my bucketlistview. Still had an issue with the adapter on the end of the day.

### 12-6
Thanks to Nina from the daily standup, I got the adapter working properly. And also implemented the google places API. And started working on the details screen of the activities.

### 13-6
Decided to not use the reminder. The idea of the bucketlist app is not to stress you out about stuff you need to do.

### 14-6
Decided that the location button will redirect you to the maps API. It was easy to implement, so why not;)

### 15-6
Got some great feedback in the presentation

### 18-6
I got a but sick, so nothing really significant has been done

### 19-6
Got the maps zoom working and got adding and saving an image working

### 20-6
Could not find a way to get the Adventure API working, but found another API http://tour-pedia.org/api/index.html that is free and will work.
This is why I deleted some attributes inside the bucketlistItem class. I won't show costs of activities anymore.
EDIT: the new API requests way too many places. Thinking of a way to reduct this amount.
