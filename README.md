# Bucketlist
This app will allow you to keep track of your bucketlist, add new items on the list and let you check them, when you've done it.
When you have done an item you will also get the opporunity to write your experience, and add a picture.

You will be logging in through facebook. This is so you can share your bucketlist with your friends. Your friends can than opt-in on your items on the bucketlist, so you can do these activities together.

## Problem statement
Life is amazing but you have to live it and not be stuck in a rut (N: "sleur"). To help keep life interesting, people make a bucketlist but this list is often forgotten or not completed.

__*Not anymore*__

Using this app, you will keep track of your bucketlist, have a clear overview, add item to the list and check them off. You will be able to set reminders for your items and share the items with friends.
The things on your bucket list does not have to be exciting skydiving/bungiejumping kind of things but it acn also just be a pub you want to visit. That is when the location function comes in handy. You can pin a location to an item to show what and where the item is located. This is done through the google maps api. Also, you can get suggestions on bucketlist items when creating a new item.
